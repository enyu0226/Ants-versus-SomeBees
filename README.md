# Ants-versus-SomeBees

This is a project adopted from UC Berkeley’s CS 61A’s Ants Vs. SomeBees. It is a tower defense game inspired by PopCap’s Plants vs Zombie and is implemented using functional and object-oriented programming paradigms in Python. The game assets and engine are already provided, I simply implemented the game logic for each role of ant army. 
(The food cost for ninja ants has been reduced to zero in order to make the game more balanced.)

This is the link to the Berkeley CS 61A website hosting the Ants Vs. SomeBees Project that contains the description of the game resources and the specification for the precise implementation of each role of ants:
